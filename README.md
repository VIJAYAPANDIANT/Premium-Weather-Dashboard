**Atmosphere** is a state-of-the-art weather forecasting dashboard that provides real-time atmospheric data, hourly predictions, and 7-day insights in a gorgeous, glassmorphic layout. The application utilizes the Open-Meteo APIs for live, keyless, and accurate updates.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Sleek Glassmorphism UI**: Beautiful, premium layout utilizing Outfit typography, Material Symbols Rounded, frosty transparency, and glowing box-shadow depth.
*   **Dynamic Weather Themes**: The atmospheric background gradient changes dynamically depending on the retrieved weather conditions (Clear, Cloudy, Rainy, Snowy, or Thunderstorm).
*   **Hourly & Daily Forecasts**:
    *   **Hourly (24h)**: An elegant, horizontally scrollable timeline showing immediate temperature and weather emoji fluctuations.
    *   **7-Day Daily List**: Compact list rows comparing day, weather description, and maximum/minimum temperature bands.
*   **Smart Query Suffix Filter**: Allows looking up cities with specific administrative or country codes (e.g. `"Miami, FL"`, `"Chennai, IN"`, or `"Paris, Texas"`), automatically resolving the most relevant location.
*   **Unified Unit Switching**: Switch between metric and imperial systems (`°C` and `km/h` vs. `°F` and `mph`) instantly across all sections with a single header toggle.
*   **Search History & Cache**: Saves your 5 most recent search queries in `localStorage` for rapid selection and retrieval, featuring individual deletion and clear-all operations.
*   **One-Page Layout Optimization**: Configured to display all modules cleanly on a single screen without clipping or cropping, automatically shifting to a scrollable block on small viewports.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **HTML5**: Defines the structured boxes, unit switch toggles, error sections, and layout containers.
*   **Vanilla CSS3**: Builds the glassmorphic styling system using variables, gradients, backdrop-filters, custom scrollbar tracks, and CSS grid/flexbox.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Handles geocoding array matching, unit math conversions, history state loops, and DOM builders.
